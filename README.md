### Hello there 👋

- I’m currently honing my frontend development skills with ReactJS.

### Tech I'm interested includes: 
- Blockchain technology
- Fintech
- NextJS

## Here is what I'm doing/aspire to be doing to delve deeper into some of these technologies:
- Learning Solidity
- Writing blogs about blockchain technology and what use-cases it has
- Creating applications with NextJS
