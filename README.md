### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

- Iâ€™m currently honing my frontend development skills with ReactJS.
- Starting Jan 24, 2022 I'm making it a goal to commit to a repo at least once a day to create a habit of coding daily, I'd like my github to be a wall of green. Check my contribution progress if you'd like.

### Current tech I'm interested includes: 
- Blockchain technology
- Fintech
- ReactJS

----------------------------------------------------------------------
## Here is what I'm doing/aspire to be doing to delve deeper into some of these technologies:

- Learning Solidity
- Writing blogs about blockchain technology and what use-cases it has
- Reading about how the underlying tech in our current financial system is very outdated and some crypto startups are doing promising things to change that
- Creating applications with ReactJS and learning more about some of it's frameworks like NextJS
